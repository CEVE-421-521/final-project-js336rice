We put in our house in galveston

Choosing Galveston Pier 21, Texas
The guage is at 29° 18.6 N, 94° 47.6 W
https://maps.app.goo.gl/GyanSMA2fp9rkVrT9

Our building is 302 17th St, Galveston, TX 77550,
Home area as estimated by google maps: 30ftx50ft home = 1500ft^2
Home value from zillow: 247,700 (Round up to 250,000)

The home is 4.41 feet or 1.34 meters above sea level in elevation.
Looking at it on street view, the house appears to be on concrete blocks about 6 inches tall, giving it an effective height of 4.91 feet.  Round this up to 5 so that it works.

Row 98 from the data is two-story, no basement in Galveston, so we'll be using that for our depth-damage curve.  The home is on concrete blocks, so we can be confident that it doesn't have a basement.
